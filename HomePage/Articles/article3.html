                <p>Most people can give blood if they are in good health. There are some basic requirements one  need to fulfill in order to become a blood donor.  Below are some basic eligibility guidelines:</p>  <hr/>
                <h2>Age</h2>
                <p>You are aged between 18 and 65.</p>
                <p>n some countries national legislation permits 16–17 year-olds to donate provided that they fulfil the physical and hematological criteria required and that appropriate consent is obtained.</p>
                <p>In some countries, regular donors over the age of 65 may be accepted at the discretion of the responsible physician. The upper age limit in some countries are 60. </p>
                
            
                        <hr/>
                <h2>Weight:</h2>
                <p>You weigh at least 50 kg.</p>
                <p>In some countries, donors of whole blood donations should weigh at least 45 kg to donate 350 ml ± 10% . </p>
                
                     <hr/>
                <h2>Health:</h2>
                <p>You must be in good health at the time you donate.

                    You cannot donate if you have a cold, flu, sore throat, cold sore, stomach bug or any other infection.

                    If you have recently had a tattoo or body piercing you cannot donate for 6 months from the date of the procedure.  If the body piercing was performed by a registered health professional and any inflammation has settled completely, you can donate blood after 12 hours.

                    If you have visited the dentist for a minor procedure you must wait 24 hours before donating; for major work wait a month.

                    You must not donate blood If you do not meet the minimum haemoglobin level for blood donation</p> 
                
                        <hr/>
                <h2>Travel:</h2>
                <p>Travel to areas where mosquito-borne infections are endemic, e.g. malaria, dengue and Zika virus infections, may result in a temporary deferral .

                Many countries also implemented the policy to defer blood donors with a history of travel or residence for defined cumulative exposure periods in specified countries or areas, as a measure to reduce the risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) by blood transfusion.</p>
                 
                
                        <hr/>
